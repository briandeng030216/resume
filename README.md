# Project

## MLB Fastball Hitting Analysis(09/2024 - 10/2024)(Python)
Link: https://github.com/briandeng030216/MLB-Hitting-Analysis
- Conducted DBSCAN clustering algorithm to split players into different groups based on their performance in multiple dimensions.
- Visualized players' contact, power, and consistency (pitch types and velocity ranges) ability through seaborn and matplotlib.
- Performed factor analysis to determine new ways to calculate players' hitting ability.
- Identified players' strengths and weaknesses of hitting fastball in multiple dimensions and generated reports.

## NBA Playoff Prediction(06/2024 - 07/2024)(R)
Link: https://github.com/briandeng030216/NBA-Playoff-Prediction
- Utilized Random Forests to predict NBA 2023 - 2024 season playoff outcomes. The model successfully predicted 5 of 8 series in first round and Boston Celtics as the final champion.
- Computed and visualized relationships between metrics and game results to identify key predictors.
- Performed feature engineering to develop new metrics, such as eFG, which resulted in more comprehensive insight of games.

## Housing Price Prediction(04/2024 - 06/2024)(Python)
Link: https://github.com/briandeng030216/Housing-Price-Prediction
- Applied machine learning methods including Gradient Boosting and Random Forests to develop predicting model with 0.925 R-Squared scores on testing sets.
- Handled missing data and transformed categorical variables into numerical forms.

## Beer Type Prediction(05/2024)(Python)
Link: https://github.com/briandeng030216/Beer-Type-Prediction
- Implemented a Support Vector Machine classifier with a linear kernel and trained the model on the training and testing datasets.
- Generated classification reports, calculating precision, recall, and F1-scores for each beer style and created confusion matrix to visualize model performance.

## MLB Ballpark Research(03/2024 - 04/2024)(Python)
Link: https://github.com/briandeng030216/MLB-ballpark-research
- Conducted a comparative analysis of teams' home run outputs with outfield dimensions.
- Utilized scatter plots to visualize relationships between outfield distances and home run frequency.

## MLB Data Analysis and Algorithm Design(07/2023 - 08/2023)(Matlab)
- Utilized Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape comprehensive hitting statistics from MLB's official website, covering the past 5 years.
- Filtered out non-referential and irrelevant data points, such as incomplete player records and non-hitting statistics and consolidated data from multiple seasons into a cohesive dataset.
- Designed a comprehensive algorithm to evaluate a hitter's overall performance.

## Music Player Development(02/2023 - 03/2023)(Java)
Link: https://github.com/briandeng030216/DSC30-Final-Project
- Designed a comprehensive relational music database to efficiently store and manage information about users, artists, albums, songs, and playlists.
- Designed a playlist feature that organizes songs in chronological or alphabetical order based on user preference.
- Developed a random playlist functionality using algorithms to shuffle songs from the music database through implementing randomized selection methods.

## Blackjack Game Development(11/2022 - 12/2022)(Python)
Link: https://github.com/briandeng030216/DSC30-Final-Project
- Developed a visually engaging blackjack game with a user-friendly graphical interface.
- Implemented a robust shuffling system using algorithms to simulate realistic card shuffling and ensured randomness and fairness in card distribution.
- Designed and integrated a winning system to determine game outcomes based on standard blackjack rules.
- Created logic to evaluate player and dealer hands, handle bets, and calculate winnings or losses accurately.

## Soccer Games Analysis and Prediction(07/2022 - 09/2022)(Python)
Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EiRPtrcLS9xAlfOuJU6768QEM4vZ5KnJGX5Xh9OLoWs/edit?usp=sharing
- Applied linear regression, decision trees, and machine learning techniques to build predictive models for game outcomes with overall 95% accuracy.
- Created new variables to evaluate team deeper performance such as offensive efficiency and identified important metrics distribution.
- Employed Matplotlib to create comprehensive visualizations of key metrics across teams and leagues.
